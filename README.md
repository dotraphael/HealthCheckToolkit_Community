# HealthCheck Toolkit
Created in 2013 by the Microsoft MVP Raphael Perez, it was an innovative tool that helps diagnose potential issues within a Configuration Manager environment in an easy and practical manner.

Over the years, the tool has changed and evolved and back in 2018, a full re-write, in PowerShell, started with the latest pieces of code completed its transition from C# to PowerShell in late March/2022.

The tool is based on pre-established rules, to assess the current status of the Configuration Managerâ€™s performance, latest updates, disk space, client data and other key indicators.

Once the data is collected, it can them be analysed and a report can be generated into a Word (or Excel) format, organised sections. The report allows a holistic and straightforward health-check analysis of the ecosystem with provided recommendations and possible fixes of known issues.
